# node_layout

Layouts per node on the Backdrop. 

# Motivation

In Drupal 7, I was able to have a layout per node that I could edit via "node/%/layout". In Backdrop, I can make layouts for patterns of paths, e.g. "content/foo/*" but not per node. Adding one per node via the layout tool becomes unmanageable. The goal for this module is to provide a way for users to create a layout per node managed by the same tabs they are used to view/edit.
